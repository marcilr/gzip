How to merge gz files


"Fast Concatenation of Multiple GZip Files
-----------------------------------------
A gzip file consists of a series of "members" (compressed data sets).
[...] The members simply appear one after another in the file, with
no additional information before, between, or after them.

  cat file1.gz file2.gz file3.gz > allfiles.gz

This worked well for me.  Note that you can confirm that this works in
most cases by doing something like the following:

  cat file1.gz file2.gz file3.gz > allfiles-cat.gz
  zcat file1.gz file2.gz file3.gz | gzip -c > allfiles-zcat.gz
  zcat allfiles-cat.gz | md5sum
  zcat allfiles-zcat.gz | md5sum

The resulting hash/message digests should be identical.

My experience is that the zcat method is around 40x slower, but the cat
method's resulting file is a few percent bigger depending on your the
gzip parameters used in the methods.

gzip, gunzip, zcat - compress or expand files


"gzip is a file format and a software application used for
file compression and decompression. The program was created 
by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler as a free software
replacement for the compress program used in early Unix
systems, and intended for use by GNU (the "g" is from "GNU").
Version 0.1 was first publicly released on 31 October 1992,
and version 1.0 followed in February 1993."
